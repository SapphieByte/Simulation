# Simulation

## *Like, a simulation or something*

### This literally serves no purpose!
Have you ever wanted a program to simulate absolutely nothing useful? Boy do I got the program for you!
### It got's the custom values!
You can chose how many generations, or "years," to run, how many creatures you wanna start out with, average lifespan of said creatures (in years), and how often deadly events occur!
### Speaking of events...
After the 100th loop, it has a random chance of spawning an event. Pandemics, famines, meteor strikes, and nuclear catastrophes can happen. What an unfortunate world.
### It also has a neat control panel!
Hidden in the mystical file of `controller.pyw` is a pygame loop that lets you control the the simulation with keybinds. Fancy.  
`[E]` Spawns a random event  
`[P]` Pauses the simulation and shows you the graph. It resumes when you close the graph.  
`[S]` Stops the simulation and shows you the graph.  
### The interface, though...
The interface is in the command line because I'm big dumb and don't know how to do that, sorry!

## *Run details and requirements*
You just need Pygame and Matplotlib. Type the following commands into the command line, seperately, and you should be good.
```
python -m pip install pygame
python -m pip install matplotlib
```

## Final words
Honestly I did this for the fun of it. I did it because I was bored. If you want a feature, post an issue. I may or may not add it. Don't cry if I don't.
