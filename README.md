# Simulation

## *Like, a simulation or something*

### This literally serves no purpose!
Have you ever wanted a program to simulate absolutely nothing useful? Boy do I got the program for you!
### It got's the custom values!
You can chose how many loops to run, how many creatures you wanna start out with, average lifespan of said creatures, and how often deadly events occur!
### Speaking of events...
After the 100th loop, it has a random chance of spawning an event. Pandemics, famines, meteor strikes, and nuclear catastrophes can happen. What an unfortunate world.
### It also has a neat control panel!
Hidden in the mystical file of `controller.pyw` is a pygame loop that lets you control the the simulation with keybinds. Fancy.  
`[E]` Spawns a random event  
`[P]` Pauses the simulation and shows you the graph. It resumes when you close the graph.  
`[S]` Stops the simulation and shows you the graph.  
### The interface, though...
The interface is in the command line because I'm big dumb and don't know how to do that, sorry!

## Final words
Honestly I did this for the fun of it. I did it because I was bored. If you want a feature, post an issue. I may or may not add it. Don't cry if I don't.
